## Project Story

This project was built during a hackathon to solve a common real-world problem: the struggle of writing professional communication quickly and effectively.

We wanted to help students, professionals, and job seekers draft emails and messages that are clear, confident, and tailored to purpose. Typewise achieves this through clean UX, smart prompting, and reliable backend integration with the Gemini 2.0 LLM.

We faced multiple challenges ‚Äî especially around **secure deployment**, **API integration**, and ensuring seamless **frontend-backend communication**. We hosted on **Netlify** and used **Firebase Functions** for the backend logic.

## What's Next

- Gmail API integration to send emails directly  
- Voice-to-text message generation  
- Multi-language support  
- AI-powered "Improve My Draft" feature
